I have used Python version 3.7.7.
My Program is quite clear from the code itself.
I have made the required tables with the given data using SQLite Studio.
I have created the python code from the command prompt using pyuic5.
For the forms to be be displayed into the window based on requirement,
I have separately created ui files and converted them into python files using pyuic5.
Then, I have used this code into my main code.
Separate folder is there for those ui and py files too.
